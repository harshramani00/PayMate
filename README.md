## Overview

PayMate is a full-stack web application that makes bill splitting simple and efficient.  
Just upload a photo of your receipt â€” our app uses **OCR (Tesseract)**, **RegEx** and **AI (OpenAI API)** to automatically detect items and prices. You can assign individuals to each item, and the app calculates each personâ€™s share, including **tax**, **tip**, and **discounts**.  

You can also view or download the final split in a clean format.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose
- **OCR**: Tesseract
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4

## How It Works

1. **Upload Receipt**: The image is enhanced and passed through Tesseract OCR.
2. **Parse Items**: OCR text is cleaned and sent to OpenAI for structured item detection.
3. **Extract Fields**: Total, tax, tip, and discount are extracted using regex.
4. **Assign Shares**: Users assign people to items manually in the UI.
5. **Finalize Split**: Backend stores the final split; frontend displays it and allows PDF download.
